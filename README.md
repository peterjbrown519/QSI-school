# QSI school

Files related to my lecture at the [QSI winter school](https://qsi.uvigo.es/conferencias/school-on-quantum-cryptograghy-sqc-padova/) on semidefinite programming. This includes the slides from the talk as well as 3 python scripts implementing examples discussed in the slides (using [PICOS](https://picos-api.gitlab.io/picos/index.html)).
